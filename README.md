Our proposed solution aims to develop a Crime Predictive Model/Tool for Hotspot Mapping that leverages data from the CCTNS and other relevant sources to identify crime hotspots and provide actionable insights for law enforcement agencies. The solution will consist of several key components:

Data Integration and Processing: Integration with CCTNS to access FIR data and other relevant crime-related datasets. Data preprocessing techniques will be employed to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

Machine Learning Model Development: Development of predictive models using machine learning algorithms to identify crime hotspots based on historical crime data, socio-economic factors, population density, and other relevant variables. Classification algorithms will categorize crimes into specific types for better analysis.

Real-time Data Integration: Implementation of real-time data integration capabilities to ensure that newly reported crime data from CCTNS FIRs is automatically aligned with the interface, enabling near real-time updates to the hotspot mapping.

User Interface: Development of a user-friendly interface for law enforcement officers to visualize crime hotspots and access relevant information. The interface will allow users to explore crime data by type, location, and time period. Additionally, police station areas will be marked out on the map for easy reference.
